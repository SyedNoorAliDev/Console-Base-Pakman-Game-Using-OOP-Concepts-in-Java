# Pakman Game in Java

This is a console based programme in which we have a Pakman and 2 Enemies moving randomly. Pakman eats food and moves, also enemies try to catch Pakman to end the game. It is an OOP based project so all the work is in form of classes.

## To run this programme
You need to put all the files in a single Folder as all are linked with each other and then try to run it. Hope so it would run finely. If you face any problem you can contact me.

## To create a pull request
I always believe that there is always an opportunity to improve things. If you want to add some new features or to improve code You need to fork this repository and then you can try to fix the bug. Then you can contact me so that I can check the improvement and can add in the code.
